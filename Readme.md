# 🔗 GitHub Import Navigator (Concept)

> Make `import` statements on GitHub **clickable** — and navigate instantly to the imported file within the repo.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**GitHub Import Navigator** is a concept project that aims to enhance the GitHub code browsing experience. It automatically detects `import` statements in source files across various programming languages and converts them into **clickable links**, allowing developers to **navigate to the corresponding files** directly.

---

## 🧠 The Problem

In large repositories, tracking where an import comes from often requires:

- Manually searching through directories
- Switching tabs
- Guessing file extensions or folder structures

**GitHub Import Navigator** proposes a solution: make the imports smart, interactive, and one-click navigable.

---

## 🚀 Planned Features

- ✅ Detect `import`/`require`/`use` statements in:
  - JavaScript / TypeScript
  - Python
  - Go
  - Rust
  - Java
  - C#
- ✅ Match import paths to actual files in the same repository
- ✅ Append clickable links or tooltips to each import
- ✅ Open target file in a **new tab**
- ✅ Full support for **GitHub’s dark mode**
- ✅ Works as a:
  - ✅ Browser Extension _(planned)_
  - ✅ Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey Script _(preferred MVP)_

---

## 💡 Example Preview (Planned)

```js
// Original
import { utils } from './lib/utils';

// Enhanced (Rendered)
import { utils } from './lib/utils'; 🔗 [Go to lib/utils.js]

🛠️ Technical Idea
📄 Use DOM selectors to extract code from GitHub’s file viewer.

🔍 Parse and detect import-like lines.

📁 Match import paths to real file paths based on repo structure.

🔗 Inject anchor tags beside detected import statements.

🌐 Open links in a new tab when clicked.

🌓 Adjust UI for both dark and light GitHub themes.

🌟 Inspiration
GitHub is great — but navigating large projects is still tedious.
GitHub Import Navigator hopes to bring IDE-like navigation to the browser.
